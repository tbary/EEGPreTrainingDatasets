# Generation of pre-training datasets for EEG classififcation
This repository contains the code of my master thesis at UCLouvain. The objective is to generate a few pre-training datasets from EEG data and to test their performances on a transformer architecture called the MViT.
Further information about this repository can be found in my master thesis (in annex A in particular).
